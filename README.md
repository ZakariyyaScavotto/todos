Making a to do list site using React that I will (hopefully) turn into my own personal chrome extension.

Note: This code is by no means all my own. I didn't have a lot of experience with React going into this project, here is a list of references/tutorials I followed while learning and making the app, full credit goes to the following references for the parts of this project where I used them:
